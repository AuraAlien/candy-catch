# Candy Challenge ftl

Simple fan game created to get back into the swing of fun development practice.

Music Credits - Gagmesharkoff - No, Iâ€™m Running

Ultra lightweight in terms of gameplay, but a finished product in terms of having sound, music, graphics and a menu.

Good first step back into rapid game dev.
